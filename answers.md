10.	The changes that were made on the repo through github do not reflect the local copy.

11.	Pushing the local version of the repository failed, because the main branch located on github differs from the local version. The main branch of the repo must be either pulled/pushed to get/set the up-to-date version that includes any changes.

12.	Once the repository was pulled from github, the changes made to README.md were reflected to the local copy on this machine.

13.	"ls -a" output:
	.  ..  .git  .gitignore  README.md
